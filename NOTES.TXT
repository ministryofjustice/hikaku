TODO
- fetch rails app. pages via a continuous path through the app (otherwise, stuff breaks)
- remove whitespace inside elements, e.g. <p>\n  somthing\n</p>
- put every tag on a separate line?
- try https://tools.ietf.org/tools/rfcdiff/rfcdiff

Process
- screen-scrape a path through the target website

- for each page
    - save a normalised version of the html as (filename from docpath)

- repeat for the comparison site

- iterate through a list of mappings of target/comparison docpath-filenames
  - generate diff report
  - add entry, with score, to a list of differences
